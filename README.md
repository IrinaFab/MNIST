# MNIST

The MNIST handwritten digits dataset is a classic computer vision dataset used for isolated handwritten digit recognition, created by researchers Burges, Cortes, and LeCun from data by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The MNIST database was designed from NIST's Special Database 3 consisting of binary images of handwritten digits by Census Bureau employees and Special Database 1 consisting of binary images of handwritten digits by high-school students.

The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 images divided into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. There are 5,000 images of the 60,000 training images kept separately for validation purposes.

The neural network model with two dense hidden layers and an output layer was trained to classified the digits from 0 to 9.
